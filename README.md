This repository contains the source code for an online internship project aimed at developing 3 java-based programs. It consists of a Number game java program, a word count java program and a student management system java program.**Usage**: To run the project locally, follow the setup instructions in the README.


1. *Number Game*:
   - *Task Description*: The Number Game is a simple guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the player attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low, and the player continues guessing until they find the correct number.
   - *Java Usage*: In this project, Java is used to handle the game logic, generate random numbers, and manage user input, a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging experience has been added.

2. *Word Counter*:
   - *Task Description*: A Word Counter is a program that reads a text document and counts the number of words in it. It also provides additional statistics such as the frequency of each word or the average word length.
   - *Java Usage*: In this project, Java is used to read and process text files, split the text into words, count them, and perform any required analysis. You can create a command-line tool or build a GUI application for user interaction. I have used command line tool for the same.

3. *Student Management System*:
   - *Task Description*: A Student Management System is a software application used by educational institutions to manage student data, including information about courses, grades, attendance, and more. It typically allows administrators, teachers, and students to interact with the system.
   - *Java Usage*: This is a more complex project that involves building a database-driven application using Java. You'll need to create data structures to store student information, implement user authentication and authorization, and design user interfaces for different types of users (admin, teacher, student).

These tasks are designed to help you practice Java programming and develop skills in different areas of software development, from basic input and output handling to more advanced features like user interfaces and data management. Depending on your level of expertise, you can start with a simpler task and progressively work on more complex projects like the Student Management System as you gain experience.
